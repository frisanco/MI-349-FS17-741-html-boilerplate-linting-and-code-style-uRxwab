    <p>
      My name is Ima Gainstdos, and I'm applying for the position of <strong>windows
      breaker</strong> at AQUOS. I would be <em>thrilled</em> to be able to work at
      the newest up-and-coming software competitor to the monopoly that is
      Microsoft and Apple.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why did I apply for this job? Well, because of the job title! My family used
    to yell at me on a daily basis for breaking windows, so I am highly confident
    that I will carry out this position to the best possible ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I sincerely hope to be considered for this position. I dropped
    out of the University of Michigan in order to pursue my dream of breaking windows,
    mostly because I knew I would never receive a college degree for such a concentration.
    </p>
